# MortyCompose

![kotlin-version](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-2.2.0-blue?logo=kotlin)


Kotlin Multiplatform sample that demonstrates use of GraphQL + Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI (based on https://github.com/Dimillian/MortyUI SwiftUI project).
Uses [Apollo library's Kotlin Multiplatform support](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/android/essentials/get-started-multiplatform/) and is also included as one of the samples for that project.

The project also now makes use of the KMP support now provided by the Jetpack Paging library.
